new key structure:
a key is generated with the master password with pbkdf2
this is added to a var when you login so you cant access the passwords without the masterpass
pbkdf2 needs a salt, so i decided to save one salt in the db which is 2 salts combined seperated by a space
then its encoded using b64

so the salts are:
passSalt keySalt
